# TECHNICAL TEST FOR BE/FULL STACK DEVELOPERS


## ASSIGNMENT

Design the architecture of a web for URL shortening, similar to [https://bit.ly/](https://bit.ly/) or [https://goo.gl/](https://goo.gl/).


### High level specification

As a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">user</span> I visit the site (which does not require a mandatory log-in) and I put in a dedicated textbox the URL I want to be shortened. On submission I'll get a shortened URL, composed by a standard domain (for example [https://short.en/](https://short.en/)) plus a univocal string, short as much as it is necessary, composed by alphanumerical characters which are simple to be inserted from a mobile phone keyboard.

(E.g. [https://www.site.com/some/path/to/a/page.html](https://www.site.com/some/path/to/a/page.html) ->[https://short.en/abcdefgh](https://short.en/abcdefgh))

The obtained shortened URL can be used by the requested or by anyone else (provided it is known, of course) without any limitation on the number of uses. When it is put in the address bar of a browser it causes a redirection to the actual original URL (which means, of course, that the underlying web serving the URL will respond with a redirection).

The shorten URL has a defined time-to-live (we can assume some months) and then expires. Expirations means that the shortened URL might no longer work in terms of redirection to the original site. It could either not redirect at all (providing a friendly message) or (less preferable) redirect to a different URL, meaning that after its expiration it has been reassigned by the system. A decision on this specific point is left to the implementation, with proper considerations to the UX of the service.

In the same web page where, as a user, I generated the shortened URL I can find a list of all other URLs generated by _the same browser _(please elaborate on this) and still valid.


## EXECUTION

As technical lead of the solution, and responsible of the architecture and implementation of the project, you are asked to describe the high-level architecture of this service (in the way you prefer – in person, with the aid of diagrams or graphs, etc.).

Here some issues we ask you to address:



1. Which functional information do you need to understand the required functionality and the related limitations? What specifications you will ask and have signed-off before proceeding with the architectural design?
2. Design the architecture of the service, with special focus on the modules composing the service, which you should be able to describe both in terms of functional responsibilities and technical components
3. Be prepared to be asked about the deploying model (CI/CD, hosting, promotion to production, etc.)
4. Be prepared to be challenged about your choices. We'll ask the rationale and the reasons of them, and we'll possibly provide different considerations, observing the way you tackle our feedback.
5. Don't limit yourself on the application layer, we'll ask you about the storage/communication services too, and will consider your choices in terms infrastructure and distribution
6. We might ask you details about the algorithm you envision for the shortening of the URLs. If you apply for a developer position, we might ask you to draft the algorithm in C#
7. We'll also elaborate with you about the possible evolution of the service: log-in, user profiling, etc.


### SUGGESTIONS



1. Don't take anything for granted, always work out the uncertainty and elaborate on your choices
2. Consider as key words for your design: resiliency, graceful degradation, stability, availability
3. Listen to suggestions and objections – dealing with the feedback is part of the job!

**Good luck!**
